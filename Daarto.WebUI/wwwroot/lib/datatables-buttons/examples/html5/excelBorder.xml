<title lib="Buttons">Excel - Customise borders</title>

<info><![CDATA[

The Excel export button saves to an XLSX file and the data can be customised before exporting the file using the `customize` method of the `b-button excelHtml5` button type.

This example demonstrates how to manipulate the file using this method to add a styling attribute to a row in the XML used to create the XSLX file. The object passed into the `customize` method contains the XSLX's file structure and the worksheet can be accessed as shown. A jQuery selector is then used to select the cells in row 10 and a border added. More complex logic (such as conditionally adding borders based on cell content) could of course be used.

The style added (index `25` in this case) is defined by the default styles included by Buttons. The full list of styles available and further information about the `customize` method are detailed in the `b-button excelHtml5` documentation.
