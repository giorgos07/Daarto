<title lib="Buttons">Keyboard activation</title>

<info><![CDATA[

Keyboard navigation is essential for fast navigation of a table operations and also for good accessibility. Buttons provides the ability to give each button a key binding - i.e. a key combination that when pressed will activate the button's action.

The key binding can be given as a single character if you wish to listen for an unmodified key press, or as an object if you wish it to only be activated when a modifier key such as shift, alt, etc, is pressed.

Only when there is no element on the page that has focus will Buttons act on a key press. This means that if you search for (for example) 1 in the DataTables search box, it will not activate _Button 1_ in this example. Having said that, adding a modifier key, such as shift or alt can often be useful to prevent accidental triggering of a button.

This example shows two buttons; the first will be activated if `1` is pressed on the keyboard. The second requires `alt + 2` to be pressed.
