<info><![CDATA[

This example shows DataTables and the Buttons extension being used with the [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) framework providing the styling.

Please note that Bootstrap 4 is still in alpha at the time this example was published and as such the integration may need to change as Bootstrap continues its development. Bootstrap 4 integration will only be made available with the DataTables downloader once a stable version of Bootstrap 4 has been released. Until then the integration files must be installed from source.

Note that for ease of implementation, the `b-init buttons` option is specified as `true` to use the default options, and the `b-api buttons().container()` method then used to insert the buttons into the document. It is possible to use the `dt-init dom` option to insert the buttons like in the DataTables styled examples, but the default `dt-init dom` option used for Bootstrap styling is quite complex and would need to be fully restated.
