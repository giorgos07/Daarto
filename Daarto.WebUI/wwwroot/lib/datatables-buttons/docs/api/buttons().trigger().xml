	<description>
		This method can be used to programmatically trigger the actions of the selected buttons. Typically a button's action will be triggered by an end user interaction (clicking, keyboard navigation), but it can be useful to trigger the action from code - for example to periodically update the data contained in a DataTable.

		Please note that some buttons types might not be able to be triggered programmatically. Specifically Adobe Flash based buttons that are used for clipboard and local file saving actions cannot be triggered without a user click action as a security mechanism that is built into Flash and cannot be overridden.
