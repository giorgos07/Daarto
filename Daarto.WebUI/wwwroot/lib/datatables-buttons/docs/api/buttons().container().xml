		The `b-init buttons` method of creating a new button set provides the ability to add only a single set of buttons at a time. However, Buttons has the ability to attach multiple sets of buttons to a single DataTable. This is done by creating additional button sets through the `new $.fn.dataTable.Buttons()` interface. Once created, the buttons can be accessed via the DataTables API as normal.

		This method is very similar to the `b-api buttons().containers()` method, in that it provides the ability to access a container element for a selected buttons instance and then insert it into the document using standard jQuery methods. However, in this case only a single Buttons instance will be included in the result. If the selector were to match multiple instances, only the first instance will be used.

		When using the `b-api buttons()` selector method, the second argument (the buttons selector) is effectively ignored when processing this method. Only the button instances are used.
