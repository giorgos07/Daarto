	<description>
		This event is triggered whenever a button's `action` method is triggered by the end user (via keyboard, mouse or touch) or by the API (`b-api button().trigger()`). It provides information about the button that was triggered through the parameters passed to it.

		Note that the event is triggered _after_ the action event. There is no ability to modify the action through this event.

		Please note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, as shown in the example below.
